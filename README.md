To run a Django app, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the version by running `python --version` in the terminal.

2. Install Django by running `pip install django` in the terminal.

3. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal. In this case, it would be `project_directory`.

4. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv env`. This will create a virtual environment named "env" in the project directory.

5. Activate the virtual environment by running `source env/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `.\env\Scripts\activate` on Windows.

6. Install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the project directory that lists all the dependencies.

7. Run database migrations by running `python manage.py migrate`. This will create the necessary database tables.

8. Start the development server by running `python manage.py runserver`. The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000/`.

9. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to access the Django app.

Remember to modify the steps according to your specific project requirements.

If you want to run this application as a Docker container, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can check the version by running `docker --version` in the terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal. In this case, it would be `project_directory_root/`.

3. Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t django-app:your_tag .` in the terminal. This will create a Docker image named "django-app" using the Dockerfile in the project directory.

4. You can run the Docker container by utilizing the `docker-compose.yml` file. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal. This will create a Docker container named "django-app" using the Docker image created in the previous step.
    (Please update all the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file before running the command accordingly)

You can find the documentation for this application in the `development_docs` folder.
